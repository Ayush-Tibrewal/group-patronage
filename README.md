##  Getting Started ðŸš€
To create a project using the example provided, follow these steps:

```npx thirdweb create --contract --template hardhat-javascript-starter```
After running this command, a project will be created with the specified template, and you can start editing the page by modifying the contracts/Contract.sol file.

If you want to add functionality to your contracts, you can leverage the **@thirdweb-dev/contracts package**, which is already installed with this project. This package provides base contracts and extensions that you can inherit from. To learn more about the available extensions and how to use them, you can refer to our **Contracts Extensions Docs**.

Start exploring and building your decentralized application using the provided example and the powerful tools and resources available to you. Happy coding! ðŸ’»

## ðŸ”¨ Building the Project
After making changes to the contract, it's time to build your project. Run the following command to compile your contracts:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
This command will compile your contracts, ensuring they are ready to be deployed and used. It's an essential step in the development process.

Once the build process is complete, you're all set to move forward with your updated and compiled contracts. Great job! ðŸš€

 This will also detect the [Contracts Extensions Docs](https://portal.thirdweb.com/contractkit) detected on your contract.

## âš¡ Deploying Contracts
When you're ready to deploy your contracts, you can use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run deploy
# or
yarn deploy
```
Running this command will initiate the deployment process for your contracts. Make sure you have the necessary network configurations set up in your project's deployment script.

Once the deployment is successful, your contracts will be deployed and ready to be interacted with. Congratulations on reaching this milestone! ðŸŽ‰

## ðŸ“¦ Releasing Contracts
If you want to release a version of your contracts publicly, you can use one of the following commands:

```bash
npm run release
# or
yarn release
```
Running this command will create a release version of your contracts, making it available for public use. It's an important step if you want to share your contracts with others or make them accessible for integration into other projects.

Once the release process is complete, you can share the released version with others and start utilizing the power of your contracts in the wider community. Congratulations on reaching this stage! ðŸŒŸ
